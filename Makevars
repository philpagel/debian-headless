# Format: DEV[,PARMS]
# DEV: typically ttyS0, ttyS1 or ttyUSB0
#
# SERIALPARMS format (according to LINUX kenrel documentation):
# depend on the driver. For the serial port this
# defines the baudrate/parity/bits/flow control of
# the port, in the format BBBBPNF, where BBBB is the
# speed, P is parity (n/o/e), N is number of bits,
# and F is flow control ('r' for RTS). Default is
# 9600n8. The maximum baudrate is 115200.
# For serial console:
CONSOLE = ttyS0,115200n8
# For local console (i.e. also offer normal non-headless installation):
# CONSOLE = tty0
